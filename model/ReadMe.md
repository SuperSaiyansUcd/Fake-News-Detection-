-   Finally, we developed the ensemble("together") model. This uses a combination of multiple model types to create a final prediction. 
-   Next came the developement of the LSTM model. It was successful and is a binary classifier
-   The developement of the BERT model was next. This was discontinued due to larck of proccessing power. Neither our local VM nor Sonic nor our local machines had enough power to create this model
-   The first model created was "bi-directional-lstm". It was a small model created mainly for testing purposes
